00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.590
Before we get started let's cover in brief what you'll be seeing throughout this course or more specifically

2
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.480
how I'll be writing and running the electron projects in the course lessons.

3
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.080
First up the project code I'll be using for this I've created a very simple boilerplate project based

4
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.470
on electron ISIS own quick start project.

5
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.200
The main difference being a reduction in code comments to better follow along on video and a few code

6
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.980
changes in preparation for upcoming changes in the electron API will cover getting this project code

7
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.210
set up in the next section of the course however.

8
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.610
Then to edit project code I'll be using the atom editor an editor that happens to be both using electron

9
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.960
any editor will do and no extensions or configuration is required although ensuring basic javascript

10
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.230
and HDMI syntax highlighting will be useful.

11
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.650
I've linked to the ATM download page in the lesson resources to run the project code.

12
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.670
Any command line tool will do.

13
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:12.120
I'll be using the hyper terminal again both using electron but the native Mac terminal or windows command

14
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.230
prompt is perfectly suitable.

15
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.490
The only prerequisite here being to have the latest version of No dodgy OS installed you can find the

16
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.930
link to the no DOJ is download page in the lesson resources.

17
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.600
I'd also encourage you to check each lessons linked resources throughout the course as you'll find any

18
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.570
valuable references to that lesson there.

19
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.840
So with that said and knowing what to expect in the next section of the course we'll get started installing

20
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.480
electron getting our project code set up and running that boilerplate project for the first time.
